            Terms and Conditions for The Internship:
            <br />
            <strong>a) </strong> The Intern must meet the eligibility criteria
            for the internship, which could include being enrolled in a degree
            program or meeting certain academic requirements as per mentioned by
            the organization.
            <br />
            <strong>b) </strong> The length of the internship should be clearly
            defined, including the start and end dates. The number of hours the
            intern is expected to work should be specified, and the intern must
            agree to the mentioned criteria by the organization to ensure that
            students and the organization end on the same page.
            <br />
            <strong>c)</strong> The internâ€™s responsibilities and duties are
            outlined, including any tasks or projects they will be expected to
            complete. The intern may be required to sign a confidentiality
            agreement, agreeing to keep any sensitive or confidential
            information they encounter during their internship confidential.
            <br />
            <strong>d)</strong> The terms and conditions for terminating the
            internship should be clearly defined, including the circumstances
            under which either party may terminate the agreement. The intern may
            be expected to adhere to a code of conduct or set of ethical
            guidelines during their internship. The intern may be evaluated on
            their performance during the internship, and the criteria for
            evaluation should be clearly stated.
            <br />
            <strong>e) </strong> Internship mentor feedback is a crucial
            component because it gives the intern insight into their performance
            and areas for development. The intern should receive specific
            examples of what they are doing well and where they can improve
            along with constructive criticism that can be put into practice. In
            order to build a stronger foundation for lasting relationships
            between the institutions and the organization, this endeavor
            continues to solicit feedback on a regular basis from the
            organization about the students and the institutions taking part in
            this process.
            <br />
            <strong>f)</strong> The intern must pay a security deposit of Rs.
            2000 for the registration process, which is partially refunded based
            on the guidelines listed below.
            <br />
            <strong>â€¢</strong> If the intern completes the internship
            successfully and in accordance with the stated guidelines, he or she
            will be eligible to receive Complete Refund.
            <br />
            <strong>â€¢</strong> Only 50% of the amount will be refunded if the
            intern receives unfavorable feedback from their mentor during their
            internship or fails to follow the stated code of conduct or set of
            ethical guidelines. This rule was added to encourage students to
            work to the best of their abilities during their internships, which
            could lead to a long-lasting partnership between the institution and
            the organization.
            <br />
            <strong>â€¢</strong> No Money will be returned to the intern if the
            intern declines the internship offer letter or leaves the internship
            before it has been approved by the organization because this will
            have a negative effect on the institution's relationship with the
            organization.
            <br />
            <strong>â€¢</strong> If the intern has already paid for the internship
            and in case, they didnâ€™t receive any intern offer letter then a
            Complete Refund will be provided to the intern.
            <br />
            <strong>g)</strong> The payment charged by the firm is for the use
            of their platform and the services they provide to connect students
            with mentors, rather than being a fee charged by the organization
            where the students are completing their internship. It's important
            for students to understand the terms and conditions of the platform
            they are using and what services they are paying for. If there are
            any concerns or questions about the payment or the internship
            itself, it's always a good idea to reach out to the platform for
            clarification.
